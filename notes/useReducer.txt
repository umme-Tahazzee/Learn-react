useReducer is a hook in React that offer more control, over state operation compared to useSate ,
 specially for complex state logic.
Components : It involve two components
           1.Reducer : pure function
           2.Action
3. initialization : it invoked as 
 const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reduce, initialState);
 
If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.
